    "## Homework Assigment One\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework activities aim, not only, at testing your ability to put into practice the concepts you have learned during the Lectures and Labs, but also your ability to explore the Python documentation as a resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, it is an opportunity for you to challenge yourself and practice. If you are having difficulties with the assignment reach out for support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homework Assigment One is divided into **three parts**:\n",
    "1. Explore the core building blocks of programming, focusing in variables, data structures, and their manipulation;\n",
    "2. Explore data loading and analysis using the core elements of Python, without fancy third-party libraries;\n",
    "3. Explore functional programming by defining different functions and operating with the map() and filter().\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission will be graded according to the following guidelines:\n",
    "1. Execution (does your program does what is asked from the exercise?\n",
    "2. Objectivity (are you using the adequate libraries? are you using a library ... );\n",
    "3. Readibility of your code (that includes comments, naming of variables, supporting text, etc ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is to be done in groups of two, groups that are caught cheating will obtain a score of 0 points. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "The Homeworking Assignment One is worth **20%** of your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission package should correspond to a .zip archive (.rar files are not acceptable) with the following files:\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebook with the output of all the cells;\n",
    "2. PDF/HTML of your Jupyter Notebook;\n",
    "3. All text or .csv files exported as part of the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes: \n",
    "- **You are ONLY allowed to use any library from the Python STL (see here https://docs.python.org/3/library/).**\n",
    "- **Comment your code properly, which includes naming your variables in a meaningful manner. Badly documented code will be penalized.**</b>\n",
    "- **Submissions in non .zip format will be penalize with 2 points.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submission is done through the respective Moodle activity.\\\n",
    "Deadline is **2022-10-02**, a Sunday, at 23:59.\\\n",
    "A penality of 1 point per day late will be applied to late deliveries."
